# Depression Text Analysis

This project explores linguistic patterns in **conversation transcripts between psychologists and patients** to understand correlations between word usage and depression levels.

The main goal is to perform **text-based exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify which words, phrases, or language features are more common among different depression labels.  
Later, the project can be extended with more advanced NLP and machine learning approaches.
